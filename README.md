**Issues**
Missing Parent Directory Error:  Running   without the   option when trying to create a nested structure like   if   or   don't exist

Permission Denied for  / :  The user forgets to use   when attempting to change ownership or group to a system user/group

**Day 8**
**Linux System Administration Users, Groups & System Security**

 Incorrectly placing NOPASSWD: could lead to either a user being prompted for a password when they shouldn't be, or worse, being granted passwordless access to all commands instead of just the intended one (/bin/df).

 Failing to use the full path for a command in the sudoers file (e.g., using ip instead of /usr/sbin/ip) could prevent the rule from working as intended, even if the command runs manually.

 

**Day 9**
**Pipelines and Text Processing, and Filters Commands**

-->Filter logs using grep to select only the lines that contain a specific event (like call drops).

-->Extract a required field (such as CELL ID) using awk, which picks specific columns from each log line.

-->Clean or normalize the extracted data using sed by removing labels, symbols, or extra spaces.

-->Sort and count occurrences using sort and uniq -c to find how many times each value appears.

-->Optionally format results by adding a header or limiting the output using head.

-->Identify the IMSIs (mobile subscribers) involved in call drops by filtering log lines and extracting IMSI fields.

-->Perform advanced filtering by selecting only call drops where the signal strength (RSRP) is worse than –105 dBm.
